# StartPage Extension for Opera
This is a simple extension what adds the keyword "sp" and the context menu item to conduct searches using StartPage.

## Notes
So, if you want to test the extension yourself, just use *yarn* or *npm* to install dependencies, and run the 'build' script.

For convenience of using StartPage, the extension supports the following options:
- Obfuscated key (prf);
- Use POST;
- Query suggestions;
- Block particular search engines.

Good luck.
