# StartPage Extension for Opera
This is a simple extension for Opera what adds the keyword "sp" and the context menu item to do search queries using StartPage.

## Options

For convenience of using StartPage, the extension supports the following options:

- **Obfuscated key** (prf)
  > your personal search key that can be generated on the setting page of StartPage.com

- **Use POST**
  > prefer to use "POST" requests instead of "GET" requests. The option works only with the keyword, and sometimes your "post" request cannot be executed due to Content Security Policy.

- **Query suggestions**
  > display query suggestions of StartPage in the omnibox.

- **Block particular search engines**
  > redirect your search request from a blocked search engine to StartPage.
  > Search engines which are available for blocking:
  > * Baidu
  > * Bing
  > * Duckduck
  > * Google
  > * Rambler
  > * Seznam
  > * Yahoo
  > * Yandex


## Development

So, if you want to test the extension yourself, just use *yarn* or *npm* to install dependencies, and run the 'build' script.

## Collaboration

Feel free to ask any questions that you have about using and developing the extension.
